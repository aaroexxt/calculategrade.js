# calculategrade.js
A javascript script that pulls data from the current tab (has to be schoolloop) and reports minimum value in each category for a threshold grade.
# Usage
Simple copy+paste the contents of calculategrade.js into any window with schoolloop. NOTE: You must click "Progress Report" on a class to get data properly. For example, I am logged in. I click on "Progress Report" for Math, and then I open a console and copy/paste the code and then execute it. Information and results are logged to the console.
# Other Notes
Made this in about 15 minutes because I didn't want to do this manually :)
